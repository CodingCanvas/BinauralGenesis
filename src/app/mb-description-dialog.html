            Binaural Beats are an auditory illusion caused by playing two tones of slightly different frequency. When listened to with
            headphones, the mind interprets it as a single rhythmic tone at a frequency identical to the difference in the
            two tone's frequencies. This illusion is thought to change the predominant neural frequency of the mind (delta,
            theta, beta, gamma) in a way that might impact one's state of mind.
