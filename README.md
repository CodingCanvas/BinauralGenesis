## What is this?
This is a binaural beat generator.  Built to be simple, no-frills, load and perform quickly, and leave you alone while you do your thing.
Binaural beats are a type of auditory hallucination, believed by some to cause shifts in your brain's dominant neural frequency.  Others use it to develop a pavlovian entrainment to focus at work, relax during a nap, or enhance a meditation sitting.  Others still just use it to take advantage of the placebo effect.
## Why does this exist?
I wanted hands-on practice with Angular, and a simple web-widget was just the ticket.  There are plenty of binaural beat applications out there, but I couldn't find any that were performant, loaded quickly, bug-free, or designed outside of the Reagan Era.
## How can I use it?
Choose the binaural frequency you want to listen to, make sure you start with a low volume, whip out your headphones and let 'er rip!
